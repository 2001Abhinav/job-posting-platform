# Netlify Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your authentication routes (`/api/login`, `/api/logout`, `/api/callback`) are showing "page not found" because they're server-side routes that need to be handled by Netlify Functions.

## The Solution
I've fixed the Netlify configuration. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Update Environment Variables in Netlify
Go to your Netlify dashboard → Your site → Site settings → Environment variables and add these:

**Required Variables:**
```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_connection_string_from_netlify
SESSION_SECRET=anyrandomsecretkey123
REPL_ID=your_replit_id_here
REPLIT_DOMAINS=your-site-name.netlify.app
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_SIDzkLGGibqEns
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=Z0Bh3UCPSCAet8FSu9CrfA9a
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 2: Get Your Neon Database URL
Since Netlify automatically created your Neon database:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Look for database connection details
5. Or check your deployment logs for the database URL

### Step 3: Update Domain Settings
After deployment, your site URL will be something like:
`https://amazing-job-platform.netlify.app`

Update the `REPLIT_DOMAINS` variable with your actual Netlify URL.

### Step 4: Redeploy
After adding the environment variables:
1. Go to "Deploys" tab in Netlify
2. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## What I Fixed
1. **Updated netlify.toml** - Better redirect handling
2. **Fixed server function** - Proper Express server integration
3. **Added serverless-http** - Handles Netlify Functions properly

## Testing Authentication
After redeployment, these URLs should work:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/login` - Sign in page
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/logout` - Sign out
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/callback` - OAuth callback

## Expected Result
- ✅ Users can sign in/sign up
- ✅ Job posting with ₹2,500 payment works
- ✅ Database stores all data
- ✅ Full functionality restored

The authentication should work properly after these changes!
